			<li>Place the peeled and quartered potatoes in a pot. Cover with at least an inch of cold water. Add a teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until tender (about 20 minutes)</li>
			<li>While the potatoes are cooking, melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a large saut&eacute; pan on medium heat. Add the chopped onions and cook until tender (6-10 minutes). Add vegetables according to their cooking time (Carrots should be cooked with the onions. Peas and corn should be added toward the end of the cooking of the onions, or after the meat starts to cook).</li>

			<li>Spread the beef, onions, and vegetables in an even layer in a large casserole dish.</li>

			<li>Place the casserole dish in the oven and cook until browned and bubbling (30 minutes). If necessary, broil for the last few minutes to brown the surface of mashed potatoes.</li>
